What is version control?
Version control keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database

Why do we use version control?
Version control is like a backup for your project, ensuring that the source code is protected. It also allows developers to work faster and more efficiently and allows teams to scale up.

Git Commands to practice:
git status - list all new or modified files to be committed
git add filename - snapshots the file in preparation for versioning
git commit -m “descriptive message” - records file snapshots permanently in version history
git push - uploads all local commits to your Github
